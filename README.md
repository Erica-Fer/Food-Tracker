## FAQ

### What is Full-Plate?

Full-Plate is a Progressive Web App, designed to help users with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, or similar dietary issues, to track their problem days and to keep a comprehensive record of what foods caused issues. It is a calendar tracker application, similar to that of Flo or Chronometer, allowing the user to mark problem days and the food which they had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It should function as an accessibility tool to support users in managing their health, as well as a means of providing evidence to medical professionals when seeking further treatment.

### Is this project open to submissions?

### How can I use Full-Plate?

As of right now, we don't have a usable program, but check back with us later! When the service is published, it will be usable from either your computer or mobile device.
